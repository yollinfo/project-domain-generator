# Domain Name Generator

Have you ever found yourself stuck trying to choose the perfect domain name but have no idea where to start? Maybe you had a few ideas about what it should be related to, but nothing concrete. Or perhaps the domain you really wanted wasn’t available. In this project, you’ll build a Domain Name Generator that takes your input and creates all possible permutations, transforming your ideas into fun and unique domain names you can use for your website! 🎉

📝 **Instructions**
---
Build a simple web page that generates all possible domain name combinations based on user input. The page already includes a form where users can input their desired pronouns, adjectives, nouns, and extensions. Basic CSS is provided to style the page, and the JavaScript handles splitting these inputs into arrays.

Your task is to write the logic that generates all permutations of these arrays and transforms them into domain names dynamically. The result should display a list of possible domain names on the page.

Here is an example: 
<img src="./assets/expected.png" alt="expected" width="800">

### Hints:
- Use nested loops or high-order functions like forEach() to create permutations.
- Concatenate strings in the format: pronoun + adjective + noun + extension.
